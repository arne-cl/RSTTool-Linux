    <segment id="132" parent="397" relname="span">Summarisation via RST-pruning was suggested by  Sparck Jones (1993),</segment>
    <segment id="133" parent="132" relname="concession">although the mechanism for determining which satellites to prune is unique here.</segment>
    <segment id="134" parent="395" relname="span">Also, her work was limited by the lack of automated RST analysis,</segment>

    <segment id="138" parent="137" relname="spatial-location"> in a full generation environment.</segment>
    <segment id="139" parent="428" relname="span">However, they prune the content structure rather than the discourse structure.</segment>
    <segment id="140" parent="425" relname="contrast">The RST tree produced to express the pruned content structure is not itself pruned.</segment>
    <segment id="141" parent="142" relname="cue">On the other hand,</segment>

    <segment id="143" parent="429" relname="span">They take intention structure into account to drive the pruning,</segment>
    <segment id="144" parent="143" relname="comment">which would be a valuable addition to the methods proposed here.</segment>
    <segment id="145">While I believe they are right in that text summarisation needs to take both these areas (and others) into account, I am interested here to see how well rhetorical structure by itself can form the basis of summarisation.</segment>
    <segment id="146">Ed Hovy, in his involvement with the HealthDoc project, has suggested generation from a master document -- a set of SPL (semantic specifications of sentences), each conditionalised by the user model (see DiMarco et al 1995).</segment>
    <segment id="147">The text actually seen by the user is achieved by pruning out SPLs which are inappropriate for the user-type.</segment>
    <segment id="148">The present system differs from this approach in that, while their master document is RST-structured, that structure is not used as the basis of the pruning, but only to restructure the pieces chosen.</segment>
    <segment id="149">Also, the production of sub-documents is intended to produce user-tailored documents, not length-tailored ones.</segment>
    <segment id="150">I am aware of work by Veli J.</segment>
    <segment id="151">Hakkoymaz (Hakkoymaz in-preparation; Hakkoymaz\&amp;Ozsoyoglu 1996) on Variable-Length Multimedia Presentations, whereby multimedia segments  are added to or dropped from a presentation in order to meet the time constraints.</segment>
    <segment id="152">That approach allows substitution of elements as well as deletion, which may be a useful technique.</segment>
    <segment id="153">\section{Variable-Length Document Presentation} Any document marked up for RST can be used for variable-length document presentation.</segment>
    <segment id="154">This section describes the process whereby the rst-structure is pruned to produce a suitable length document.</segment>
    <segment id="155">\subsection{Assigning Relevance Scores to Text Nodes} As described in the introduction, the basic mechanism involves assigning each structural relation a relevance score between 0.0 and 1.0.</segment>
    <segment id="156">For instance, \relname{elaboration} may have a score of 0.40 (low relevance), while \relname{purpose} might be scored more highly.</segment>
    <segment id="157">By an RST-tree, I assume a tree with the top-nucleus as the root of the tree, and satellites hanging off this, and their satellites hanging off of them.</segment>
    <segment id="158">Our task is then to prune branches off of this tree.</segment>
    <segment id="159">The top-nucleus has a relevance value of 1.0 (maximum relevance).</segment>
    <segment id="160">Through a process of recursive descent, we assign each node in the tree the relevance level of its parent,  multiplied by the relevance score of the relation which connects them to the parent.</segment>
    <segment id="161">For instance, an \relname{elaboration} of the top-nucleus would have relevance 0.4 (1.0 * 0.4), while an \relname{elaboration} of that node would have relevance 0.16 (0.4 * 0.4).</segment>
    <segment id="162">Nodes lower in the RST-tree (less nuclear) will thus have lower relevance than higher nodes (more nuclear), and will thus be the first to be pruned.</segment>
    <segment id="163">This is a simple mechanism,</segment>
    <segment id="398"> but it has shown good results in producing reasonable texts at whatever degree of verbosity.</segment>
    <segment id="164">It is easy to see that</segment>
    <segment id="403"> an elaboration of an elaboration will in most cases be less essential to a text than the elaboration itself.</segment>
    <segment id="165">However, there are some cases where this method breaks down</segment>
    <segment id="404"> -- nuclearity does not always reflect centrality of information.</segment>
    <segment id="166">Sometimes an author introduces information</segment>
    <segment id="406"> in a rhetorically unimportant place,</segment>
    <segment id="405"> yet that information may be needed later</segment>
    <segment id="407"> to understand the argument.</segment>
    <segment id="167">One example of this in the summary shown earlier is where the original text had said:</segment>
    <segment id="408"> {\em he was faced with constant pressure from Edward to sign.</segment>
    <segment id="168">He refused to do so}.</segment>
    <segment id="169">In the summary, ``to sign&apos;&apos; was pruned as unnecessary,</segment>
    <segment id="396"> but it was actually a central concept,</segment>
    <segment id="391"> and the anaphoric ``so&apos;&apos; failed because of its pruning.</segment>
    <segment id="170">The text-nodes are then placed in a queue,</segment>
    <segment id="409"> position based on their relevance score.</segment>
    <segment id="171">\subsection{Pruning the RST-tree}</segment>
    <segment id="410"> When a request is received to display the text at a particular length,</segment>
    <segment id="411"> the  system  needs to determine  which  text-nodes to display.</segment>
    <segment id="172">Taking each node in  turn from  the relevance queue</segment>
    <segment id="412">  (starting  with the most relevant),</segment>
    <segment id="413"> the program checks to see</segment>
    <segment id="414"> if  including this text node will push the word-count over  the limit.</segment>
    <segment id="173">If not</segment>
    <segment id="415">  it adds the node to  the nodes-to-be-expressed list,</segment>
    <segment id="416"> and increments the words-so-far count.</segment>
    <segment id="174">When the word-limit is exceeded,</segment>
    <segment id="417"> the procedure then turns to expressing the selected nodes.</segment>
    <segment id="175">The nodes are expressed</segment>
    <segment id="418"> in the order in which they appeared</segment>
    <segment id="419"> in the original full text.</segment>
    <segment id="176">Note that the satellites of a node will always have lower or equal relevance than the node itself,</segment>
    <segment id="420"> so we never include a satellite in the nodes-to-be-expressed list</segment>
    <segment id="421"> if its nucleus is not,</segment>
    <segment id="422"> which may produces incoherency.</segment>
    <segment id="177">\pagebreak \subsection{Extensions on Basic RST} The RST Markup Tool, and consequently document presentation, allows markup of more than simple nuclear-satellite relations.</segment>

    <segment id="190">The system comes with three inbuilt `user-models&apos;, representing different ranges of interest: ({\em standard}, (average values), {\em how\&amp;why} preferring cause, reason, purpose, conditionals, etc., and {\em when\&amp;where}, preferring spatial- and temporal-locations and extents.</segment>

    <segment id="211">These aspects will be covered below under four topics: paragraphing, punctuation, referring expressions and discourse markers.</segment>
    <segment id="212">\negnegspace \subsection{Paragraphing} \negnegspace Deleting sentences without changing paragraph boundaries would produce a text of many short paragraphs, reducing readability.</segment>
    <segment id="213">Rather than attempt to repair document paragraphing, we have found it easier to throw away the original paragraphing, and re-determine paragraph boundaries as described below.</segment>
    <segment id="214">Paragraphing within a document is intended\to make it easier to read.</segment>
    <segment id="215">It segments the discourse into small chunks of sentences which are to some degree highly related.</segment>
    <segment id="216">We found it plausible to use our RST structure to help in determining paragraph boundaries.</segment>
    <segment id="217">From looking at texts, it is the usual case to see a paragraph representing a nucleus and its satellites (although some other of its satellites be in other paragraphs).</segment>
    <segment id="218">There is a useful notion used in speech synthesis and generation which claims that the spacing between spoken words can be predicted largely by the {\em syntactic distance} between them -- the number of branches which have to be traversed in the parse tree to move from one word to the other.</segment>
    <segment id="219">Thus, in {\em the Girl Guides fish}, we would expect little pause between noun {\em Guides} and its modifier {\em Girl}, while in the homophone {\em the girl guides fish} we would expect more pause between the verb {\em guides} and the subject {\em girl}.</segment>
    <segment id="220">We have applied this principle to paragraphing, arguing that two adjacent sentences which are more discoursally distant (more structurally separated in terms of the RST-tree)  are more likely to be separated by a paragraph break.\footnote{An alternative approach might evaluate potential paragraph breaks on the basis of the {\em number} of nucleus-satellite links that boundary breaks compared to other possible breaks.</segment>
    <segment id="221">This approach would reward paragraphs which are sub-trees of the RST.</segment>
    <segment id="222">In addition, we might penalise what we might call {\em foster} sentences -- sentences  which have no direct relation to the other sentences in that paragraph.} This is not the whole story however.</segment>
    <segment id="223">Paragraphing is also constrained by the needs of {\em paragraphic rhythm}.</segment>
    <segment id="224">Martinec (1995) argues that the division of texts into paragraphs is similar to the rhythmic structure of the sentence (divided into tonic feet of similar interval).</segment>
    <segment id="225">Both are means of organising information into manageable chunks.</segment>
    <segment id="226">The {\em rhythm} of a text requires that these chunks are of approximately the same size, not too long, not too short.</segment>
    <segment id="227">Our paragraphing algorithm combines these two notions -- semantic distance and paragraphic rhythm -- to determine paragraph boundaries in the presented texts.</segment>
    <segment id="228">We assume there is an ``ideal&apos;&apos; paragraph length for the text, the paragraph rhythm (user configurable).</segment>
    <segment id="229">Starting at the beginning of the text, we test each point between sentences for a possible paragraph-break.</segment>
    <segment id="230">We evaluate two factors:  Semantic Distance: how many arcs of the RST-tree do we need to traverse to get from one sentence to the other.</segment>
    <segment id="231">In a sense, we are looking for the weak-points in the text, textually adjacent sentences which are not semantically closely related.</segment>
    <segment id="232">\item {\bf Projected Paragraph Size}: how much smaller or larger than our ideal would the paragraph be if we broke the paragraph at that point.</segment>
    <segment id="233">\negnegspace \end{enumerate} We use the following formula to evaluate each possible paragraph break, and select the point with the lowest value (I will leave fuller explanation to a paper dedicated to the topic):  Score(N_i,N_{i+1}) = (ideal\_length - actual\_length)^{j} + \frac{k}{sem\_dist(N_i,N_{i+1})} \] ...where ideal\_length, {\em j} and {\em k} are constants.</segment>
    <segment id="234">I have found best results with values of 150, 1.2 and 75.</segment>
    <segment id="235">Lower values of j allow more variation of paragraph size in seeking for better breaks on semantic distance grounds.</segment>
    <segment id="236">Once a paragraph position is selected, we take that as our starting point and look for the next paragraph boundary after that, until the end of the text is reached.</segment>
    <segment id="237">As you can see from figures 1 and 2 (both paragraphed using the above formula), the method produces quite plausible paragraphing.</segment>
    <segment id="238" parent="239" relname="circumstance">\subsection{Punctuation} As reported above, we have allowed the RST Tool to assign structure {\em within} the sentence as well as {\em between} sentences.</segment>
    <segment id="239">This however creates a problem because, in deleting an intra-sentence nucleus, we may also delete the punctuation it carries.</segment>
    <segment id="240">For instance, in (N: {\em Edward surrendered,})(S: {\em in 1245}), deletion of the nucleus leaves us with a sentence terminated by a comma.</segment>
    <segment id="241">One module of the present system has been developed to correct such problems.</segment>
    <segment id="242">It ensures all sentences start with a capital, and recovers the sentence-terminating punctuation from any pruned segments where necessary.</segment>
    <segment id="243">\subsection{Referring Expressions} When deleting sections of a text, we may destroy the referential cohesion of a text in two ways.</segment>
    <segment id="244">Firstly, we might delete the introduction of an entity, which provided the entities name, or other characteristics which allow the reader to identify the entity correctly.</segment>
    <segment id="245">The remaining text may refer to this entity (e.g., ``he&apos;&apos;), but leave no clue as to who the entity is.</segment>
    <segment id="246">The second, related, problem involves changing the referential environment of entities.</segment>
    <segment id="247">References which are contextually unambiguous in the full text may be brought into close proximity to other entities which are potential confusers.</segment>
    <segment id="248">In the system as implemented so far, there has been no attempt to correct these problems.</segment>
    <segment id="249">Cases of problems have been rare.</segment>
    <segment id="250">However, for the next stage of implementation we are planning to introduce NP markup into the document preparation stage, allowing the document editor to indicate co-reference of NPs in the text.</segment>
    <segment id="251">This would be a simple matter of allowing the editor to drag from each NP to a co-referring NP.</segment>
    <segment id="252">From this markup, we can deduce various things.</segment>
    <segment id="253">We can identify the first-occurring reference for each entity, and with a reasonable level of certainty, use this as the first-mention of the entity in any pruned-text.</segment>
    <segment id="254">We can analyse the remaining references to discover gender (from pronouns) or class (from definite or indefinite references).</segment>
    <segment id="255">Where text-pruning places two entities of similar gender in proximity, the class-based or name-based reference form could be used if available.</segment>
    <segment id="256">In this way, many of the reference problems can be repaired.</segment>
    <segment id="257">An anaphora generation module being developed by Janet Hitzeman is a good candidate for use here.</segment>
    <segment id="258">The extra cost of NP markup needs to be weighed against the gain of coherency gained.</segment>
    <segment id="259">\subsection{Discourse Markers} Markers of rhetorical relations are usually attached to satellites, and so there is no problem when the satellite is pruned.</segment>
    <segment id="260">However, in some peoples analyses, some relations mark the nucleus, not the satellite.</segment>
    <segment id="261">In others, both the nucleus and satellite are marked (e.g., if/then).</segment>
    <segment id="262">When we delete the satellite, we should ensure that the discourse marker is removed also from the nucleus.</segment>
    <segment id="263">However, due to the rarity of nucleus marking, this problem rarely occurs.\footnote{In the case of if/then, I have the \relname{ELABORATION} relation set to 100\% relevance, since a clause without its condition has a totally different meaning.} For those cases where nucleus marking does occur, a future applications might avoid the problem by removing all discourse markers from the marked-up text, and generating these as appropriate.</segment>
    <segment id="264">However, I envisage problems associated with this approach, including over-generation of discourse linkers (many are left implicit).</segment>
    <segment id="265">\pagebreak \section{Document Preparation} Before the text can be used for variable-length presentation, it needs to be marked-up in terms of RST structure.</segment>
    <segment id="266">To facilitate this step, we have developed an RST Markup Tool, which allows a user to: \begin{enumerate} \item Segment the text.</segment>
    <segment id="267">\item Graphically link these segments together into an RST-tree.</segment>
    <segment id="268">\end{enumerate} \subsection{Text Segmentation} Each of these tasks has a separate interface within the tool.</segment>
    <segment id="269">The first is shown in figure~\ref{fig:segment}.</segment>
    <segment id="270">The buttons ``Sentences&apos;&apos; and ``Paragraphs&apos;&apos; result in automatic recognition of sentence and paragraph boundaries.</segment>
    <segment id="271">If further segmentation is required, the user can switch into {\em segmentation} mode, during which they need only click at each segment boundary to introduce a segmentation marker.</segment>
    <segment id="272">To edit the text (modifying the text,  correcting spelling errors, etc.), switch to the {\em Edit} mode.</segment>
    <segment id="273">\begin{figure*} \begin{center} \epsfxsize=5.5in \leavevmode % force centering \epsfbox{segment.eps} \negnegspace \negnegspace \caption{Text Segmentation Tool} \negnegspace \negnegspace \label{fig:segment} \end{center} \end{figure*} A  problem occurs with {\em embedded elements} -- cases where a rhetorically dependent stretch of text occurs within another node.</segment>
    <segment id="274">For instance, we might wish to treat the embedded clause in the following as dependent on the main clause: {\em John, -- I think you know him -- is here for two weeks.} At present, the interface does not handle such cases.</segment>
    <segment id="275">A simple solution is for the user to move the embedded text outside of the enclosing text.</segment>
    <segment id="276">\subsection{Text Structuring} The second step of document preparation involves structuring the text.</segment>
    <segment id="277">Another interface of the RST Markup Tool allows the user to connect the segments into a rhetorical structure tree, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:structure}.</segment>
    <segment id="278">We have followed the graphical style presented in Mann \&amp; Thompson (1987).</segment>
    <segment id="279">\begin{figure*} \begin{center} \epsfxsize=5.5in \leavevmode % force centering \epsfbox{rstedit.eps} \negnegspace \negnegspace \caption{Text Structuring Tool} \negnegspace \negnegspace \label{fig:structure} \end{center} \end{figure*} Initially, all segments are unconnected, ordered at the top of the window.</segment>
    <segment id="280">The user can then drag the mouse from one segment (the nucleus) to another (the satellite).</segment>
    <segment id="281">Upon releasing the mouse button, the system offers a menu of relations to choose from (the user can use the relation-sets provided with the system, or provide their own).</segment>
    <segment id="282">The system allows both plain rst-relations and also multi-nuclear relations (e.g., joint, sequence, etc.).</segment>
    <segment id="283">Scoping is also possible, whereby the user indicates that the nucleus of a relation is not a segment itself, but rather a segment and its satellites.</segment>
    <segment id="284">See figure~\ref{fig:example} for an example of both a multi-nuclear structure, and scoping.</segment>
    <segment id="285">In addition, McKeon-style {\em schemas} (sometimes called {\em story-grammars}) can be used to represent constituency-type structures.</segment>
    <segment id="286">See figure~\ref{fig:joke}.</segment>
    <segment id="287">\begin{figure} \begin{center} \epsfxsize=3.9in \leavevmode % force centering \epsfbox{example.eps} \negnegspace \negnegspace \caption{Scoping and multi-nuclear relations} \negnegspace \negnegspace \label{fig:example} \end{center} \end{figure} \begin{figure} \begin{center} \epsfxsize=3.9in \leavevmode % force centering \epsfbox{joke.eps} \negnegspace \negnegspace \caption{Constituent Structure} \negnegspace \negnegspace \label{fig:joke} \end{center} \end{figure} The user can switch freely between text segmentation and text structuring mode -- to edit text, or to change segment boundaries.</segment>
    <segment id="288">The system keeps track of the structure assigned so far.</segment>
    <segment id="289">If the user, in editing the text, deletes a segment, the system forgets structuring information concerning that segment.</segment>
    <segment id="290">Because rst-structures can become very elaborate, the RST Tool allows the user to {\em collapse} sub-trees -- hiding the substructure under a node, This makes it easier, for instance, to connect two nodes which normally would not appear on the same page of the editor.</segment>
    <segment id="291">The user can save the present state of the screen as postscript, for inclusion in Latex documents.</segment>
    <segment id="292">Alternatively, a snapshot utility can be used to save selected parts of the structure in other formats.</segment>
    <segment id="293">The structured text can be saved to a file, for later re-editing, or for use in variable-length document presentation.</segment>
    <segment id="294">\pagebreak \section{Summary} This paper has described a system for presenting variable-length on-line documentation, which allows the user to select the degree of verbosity of the text presented.</segment>
    <segment id="295">The results so far on a small-scale have shown that reasonable-quality texts can be produced dynamically.</segment>
    <segment id="296">The cost of document markup stops this approach being used on texts of short display-life, but makes it economical for documents of longer duration where length-variability has value.</segment>
    <segment id="297">Apart from text-length, Variable-Length documents allow the user a small degree of content-control, to the degree that they can determine the relevance of each RST relation (or of elements of a schema).</segment>
    <segment id="298">The major problem for the system involves restoring coherence after text-pruning, particularly in areas of reference, discourse markers, paragraphing and punctuation.</segment>
    <segment id="299">The problems of paragraphing and punctuation have been solved, and solutions are suggested for the other two areas.</segment>
    <segment id="300">Another problem occurs when material important to the text is not included in nuclear positions in the RST-tree: nuclearity does not guarantee importance to discourse goals (although there is a strong correlation between nuclearity and importance).</segment>
    <segment id="301">This is why, in the long term, approaches such as Rino\&amp;Scott (1996), which take intentional structure as well into account show some promise.</segment>
    <segment id="302">While information about intention structure is not easy to mark up, it would be available in a system doing full text generation from intentions.</segment>
    <segment id="303">Regardless of the problems of this approach, the system is up and running on-line.</segment>
    <segment id="304">New documents are being added as time allows, to test the generalisability of the approach.</segment>
    <segment id="305">Future development will include features  such as allowing the user to zoom in on text by clicking on it.</segment>
    <segment id="306">I will soon make sentence punctuation hyper-clickable, which would result in the pruned text under that sentence being provided.</segment>
    <segment id="307">The notion of variable length on-line documents has great value to information providers and information readers alike -- imagine if this document had been provided variable-length, you could have read the two page version instead!</segment>
