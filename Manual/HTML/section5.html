<H1 align=center><a name=top>5. Structuring Text </H1>
<P align=center>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The next step involves structuring the text. The second 
interface of the RSTTool allows the user to connect the segments into a 
rhetorical structure tree, as shown in figure 2. We have followed the graphical 
style presented in Mann &amp; Thompson (1987). <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="structurer.gif" > 
<br>Figure 2: The Structurer interface. </CENTER>
<P>Initially, all segments are unconnected, ordered at the 
top of the window. The user can then drag the mouse from one segment (the 
satelite) to another (the nucleus) to link them (see instructions below). 
<P>The system allows both plain RST relations and also 
multi-nuclear relations (e.g., joint, sequence, etc.). Scoping is also possible, 
whereby the user indicates that the nucleus of a relation is not a segment 
itself, but rather a segment and all of its satellites. See figure 3 for an 
example combining normal RST relations (Coocurrence, Cause); multi-nuclear 
structure (Conjunction), and scoping (the nodes marked 3-4 and 5-6). In 
addition, McKeon-style <I>schemas</I> can be used to 
represent constituency-type structures. See figure 4.

<P><B>Where to Click</B>: For all 
interface actions involving clicking on the interface, a box will appear under 
the nodes which are valid to click upon when the mouse cursor is over them. For 
instance, in link mode, only those text nodes which are not currently a satelite 
of any node will hilight. When dragging from a satelite to a nucleus, only those 
objects on the screen which can be dragged to will be boxed. Note however that 
boxing does not apply to actions such as changing relation names (see below) or 
collapse/expand of structure. 
<P>In the following, &quot;clicking&quot; on a node implies 
the left button on multiple-mouse systems (e.g., Sun, PC).

            <OL>
                <LI>Make sure you are in the 
                &quot;Link&quot; mode: the &quot;Link&quot; button should be 
                depressed, and the cursor should change to a 
                &quot;&lt;-&gt;&quot; (only when over the edit canvas).&nbsp; 
                <LI>Then, click down on the satelite node 
                and drag to the nucleus (following the direction in which the 
                RST arrow should be drawn). Then Release.&nbsp; 
                <LI>A menu will be offered of the available 
                relations. Select one by clicking on it.&nbsp; 
                <LI>The nodes will then be linked.&nbsp; 
                </LI></OL>
            <P><B>Where to 
            Click:&nbsp; </B>when connecting two nodes,&nbsp; you need to click on the 'text' part of the node. This will be 
            the text of a leaf node.&nbsp; For span, multinuclear and schema 
            nodes, click on the text indicating the span (e.g., 1-3). The 
            applicable screen objects will be boxed when the mouse is over 
            them.&nbsp; 
            <P><B>Illegal Links</B>: 
            If the link is illegal for some reason (e.g., the satelite already 
            has a nucleus), then no link will be formed.&nbsp; 
            <P><B>Linking to a 
            Multinuclear or Schema Node</B>: If the nucleus is a multinuclear or 
            schema node, you will first be asked whether you want to link the 
            nodes using a simple RST relation or multinuclear/schema relation. 
            If you select multinuclear, then the node will be linked using the 
            same relation as the other element(s) of that multinuclear 
            structure. If you select &quot;schema&quot;, then you will be 
            presented with a list of the possible elements of the schema.&nbsp; 
            <P><B>Linking Distant 
            Nodes</B>: <font color=red>[NEW] </font>When two nodes to be linked are not present on the page 
            at the same time, you cannot drag between them. To link them, shift-click
	    on the satelite, then scroll the page to bring the nucleus into view.
	    click on this node to link the satelite to it. 
            <P><B>
Choosing the 
            Relation
</B>: the list of relations offered to you is contextually 
            restricted, e.g., when linking to a schema, only the elements of 
            that schema will be offered.&nbsp; 
            
<P>
	If none of the offered relations are 
            appropriate for this instance (the relation is not yet defined in 
            the system) you can press the &quot;Add New&quot; button at the 
            bottom of the relation list to define a new relation. It will be 
            added to the Relation Set.&nbsp;

        <TD> Because RST-structures can

            node, This makes it easier, for instance, to connect two nodes which 
            normally would not appear on the same page of the editor.&nbsp;

                <LI>To collapse structure, click on the 
                <EM>Collapse/Expand</EM>  mode button. The cursor, when over 
                the analysis space, should change to an up-down arrow. The 
                cursor changes to an up-arrow when over a unit which can be collapsed 
                (any nonterminal node). Collapsed structure is indicated by a 
                triangle on the display.</LI></UL>
