All we can dois save the diagram as a postscript file and try to send this file to the printer.This is only possible in some cases:<p><ul> <li><b>Unix/Linux</b>: Printing should not be a problem. Just click on the "Print Canvas"button (in Structure mode) to send the diagram to the printer. <li><b>Windows</b>: The "Print Canvas" button will only work if you are usingTcl/Tk 8.0, 8.1 or 8.2. For those with the latest versions (8.3x or 8.4x), thedll (dynamic load library) for printing from Tcl/Tk doesn't exist yet. I amstill waiting for it to appear. <br>  In some cases, users report that the printed diagram comes out too smallto be of use ("postage stamp size" according to Bill Mann). I think this isa problem with the type of printer, or the printer driver, but I don't know.<p><li><b>Macintosh</b>: Currently, the "Print Canvas" button does not functionon Macintoshes. Maybe in the future.</ul>  If the "Print Canvas" button works for you, the program should send thewhole structure directly to the printer. if the diagram is larger than a singlepage, it will be printed over several pages.<p>  If the  "Print Canvas" button doesn't work for you, there are several solutions:<ol><li><b>Downgrade Tcl/Tk</b>: If you are a Windows user, uninstall Tcl/Tkand install version 8.2, which supports printing. See the Tcl/Tk websitementioned in section 2.<li> <b>Indirect Printing</b>: Otherwise, you might try saving thediagram as a postscript file (hitting the "Save PS" button). You canthen print this file (see below). Note however, that the structure is written tothe PS file as a single page, so structures spanning multiple pagescannot be printed in this way. I am still looking for a solution to thisproblem.<li> <b> Saving in other format and printing from application</b>: asdescribed below, you can save the diagram as a PDX diagram, whichMayuraDraw can deal with. Using Mayura (Windows only), you can thenre-export the diagram as either WMF (windows meta file), PDF, EPS, AI(Adobe Illustrator), etc. You may have an application which can readin one of these formats, and deal with it intelligently (i.e.,multi-page printing). I don't know of one yet, but I don't owncommercial software.<br>  Note that for printing a single-page diagram, exporting as PDFand printing that is a good option for all platforms. </ol><hr><h2>Exporting RST diagrams in various graphical formats</h2>  As mentioned above, RSTTool allows you to export diagrams in two formats(PS and PDX), and one of these (PDX) can in turn be saved as a numberof other formats (Windows only at present).<h3>Saving PS Files</h3>When you click on the "Save PS" button, you will be presented with a dialogasking you to "click on the top node of the RST tree to save". Hit the "OK"button, and the cursor changes to a "T". Click on a node of the RST Structure and it, and all its dependent structure, will be saved to a file as postscript. You will be askedfor a place to save the file.<p>  The PS file can be sent to a printer (under Unix: "lpr &lt;filename&gt;").Alternatively, it can be inserted into Latex or Microsoft Word (perhaps other word processingpackages also) and printed as part of that document. See below for details.<p>Some people report that the PS file saved by RSTTool is truncated to the right.However, I don't think the files are truncated, rather, Ghostview (a viewerfor postscript files) only shows the first print page of the diagram. If youresize the page larger, you can see more of the diagram.<p>  However, I still don't know how to print these files over multiple pages.<h3>Saving PDX Files</h3>When you click on the "Save PDX" button, you will be asked if you wish tosave the entire canvas ("All") or just the subtree under a particular node.If you select the first, you will then be asked where to save the file.If you select the subtree approach, you will be asked to click on a node,and then the file selection dialog will appear.  Once saved, the PDX file can be loaded using Mayura Draw (obtain from <a href="http://www.mayura.com">http://www.mayura.com</a>). Using this package you can:<ul><li>Edit the diagram to your taste.<li>Export the diagram to other more useful formats (for inclusion in MS Word for instance).</ul>  Longer analyses seem to be truncated once loaded into Mayura, butthis is a bug in the display, rather than in the file. If you export the diagramand insert into MS Word (see below) you can see the whole diagram.<p>  See the "Export" option under the "File" menu. The useful options  here are: WMF and EPS (for inclusion in MS Word documents, PDF (for  distribution to other people), and maybe AI (Adobe Illustrator).<p><b>Telling PDX which font to use</b>: Font names used in PDX files are different than those usedin Tcl/Tk. To get round this problem, there is a file in Library/FONT_MAPwhich states which PDX font to use for which TCL font.<ol><li> Finding out the Tcl/Tk name of your font: Select "Appearance Options" from the "Options" menu. Your Current font name will be displayed, e.g., "MS Sans Serif".<br><li> Finding out the name of the font in PDX: Open Mayura Draw. Select"Font..." from the "Text" menu, and you will see a list of font names.Select one, and copy the name to the clipboard. <br><li> Open the RstTool folder: Library, and edit the file "FONT_MAP".add a line like the ones already there, e.g.,<p>MS Sans Serif: TimesNewRomanPSMT<p>Save the file. </ol>The new font should be used in your pdx files from then on.<p><hr><h2>Including Diagrams in your Documents</h2> Once you have your diagram saved as a file, you can include it in other documents, for instance, academic papers.<ul><li><b>Latex</b>: To include a document in latex, saving as a ps fileshould be adequate. These files can using the epsfig package. If youare on Windows, you can also try saving as PDX, and using Mayura tosave as EPS.<li><b>Microsoft Word</b>: Two formats exported by Mayura Draw can beinserted into MS Word documents (and perhaps other wordprocessing packages):<ul><li><b>Encapsulated Postscript (EPS)</b>: this format can be includedin Microsoft Word documents, depending on the version. For instance,under Office 98, select "Picture..." from the "Insert" menu. andselect the file. Note that eps or ps files cannot be inserted in olderversions of MS Word. If inserted, EPS graphics may not be displayed inthe document properly, but will print ok on a postscript printer. EPSwon't print properly on a non-postscript printer.  If it doesn't workfor you, try the WMF format (below).<br><li><b>Windows Meta File (WMF)</b>:  this format is more robust (works on moreversions of MS Word, and on non-postscript printers), but the picture qualityis slightly worse in the printing. Insert in the same way as explained for EPS just above.</ul><li><b>The Web</b>: The best way to get RST diagrams onto your web pagesis to:  Save the diagram as pdx format. Load it into Mayura, and "Export"as JPG. Ensure that Smoothing is Maximal or Normal, and Quality is "High".This produces a JPG version of your entire structure which is of good readable quality.<p>The alternative is to do a screen dump (capture the screen as abitmap), trim off parts of the image you don't want, and save as a gifor jpg. However, if your diagram doesn't display in a single page, you will needto join the separate screen captures together. Messy.<br>  <li><b>Drawing Packages</b>: The AI format exported by Mayura can beloaded into CorelDraw, Micrografx Windows Draw, and possibly other programs.<ul><li><b>Unix/Linux</b>: various programs exist to capture a window either to a file or to the clipboard. On Unix, I use Snapshot, which allows me to select a region of the screen,and then use XV to save the resulting file as jpg or gif. Other solutions exist.<br><li><b>Windows</b>: Bring RSTTool to the front, with the structure you wantcaptured clearly displayed. Press the "Alt" key at the same time as the "Print-Scrn"key, and the top window will be saved in the clip board. Then Open yourfavourite graphic editor (I use Paintshop Pro) and paste the diagram into a new screen. Then trim out parts of the window you don't want, and save the diagram as jpg or gif.<br><li><b> Macintosh</b>: There are tools on the Mac to do the same as in the above.I am no longer a Mac user, so don't know their names.<br></ul></ul><hr><h2>Sharing Analyses with other people</h2>The RS2 format (RSTTool's native format) is easily distributable, but they need the program.<p> I think the best option here is PDF: Mayura exports in this format, which is readily viewed on all platforms, with Adobe Acrobat Reader (available free from <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html">Adobe</a> for all platforms).  The clarity is very good.<p><P><center><TABLE border=1>        <TR>        <TD><A href="section6.html#top" >Prior             Section</A></TD>        <TD><A href="index.html#top" >Contents</A> </TD>        <TD><A href="section8.html#top" >Next             Section</A></TD></TR></TABLE><P></P></center></body></html>
