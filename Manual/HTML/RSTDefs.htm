Set</font></font></b></center>

<p><font size=+1>This page provides recognition criterion for the rhetorical
relations used by Bill Mann. It was lifted from his RST web site (with
permission). This page is from the 7th Jan 2000 version. Updated versions may be available from his site. See <a href="http://www.sil.org/linguistics/rst/toolnote.htm"> here</a>.</font>

<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;</font><b><font size=+2>The RST relation definitions</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Bill Mann</font></b></center>

<p><font size=+1>The set of tables below names the relations of so called
CRST, "Classical RST" as Nick Nicholas calls it. It has been augmented
with four relations defined more recently.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Click on a relation name to see the definition on this
page. Each element of the definition is implicitly embedded in a constraint
formula as follows: "It is plausible to the analyst that it was plausible
to the author that ... ."</font>
<p><font size=+1>The tables which are reached by clicking a relation name
give the relation definitions for each relation of CRST. The added relations
are Means, Preparation, Unconditional and Unless.</font>
<p><font size=+1><b>On terminology in definitions:</b> <i>N</i> stands
for nucleus, <i>S</i> for satellite, <i>W</i> for writer (author, speaker)
and <i>R</i> for reader (hearer.) For some brevity: in many places, N and
S stand for the <i>situations</i> presented by N and S; N and S never stand
for the text of N or S. <i>Situation</i> is a broad cover term that ranges
over propositions or beliefs, actions whether realized or not, desires
to act and approval for another to act. Similarly, <i>positive regard</i>
is a broad attitudinal term that ranges over belief, approval of ideas,
desire to act, and approval for another to act, all identifiably positive.
Positive regard and <i>belief</i> (with its cognates), and <i>plausible</i>
above are all degree terms, not binary.</font>
